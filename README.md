# PRIMO

PRIMO stands for PRIvacy and MObility.

PRIMO investigates how user data is collected and exploited through smartphone apps developed to support mobility practices, from navigation to trip planning or ticket reservation and electric vehicle charging.

PRIMO focuses on two key components of sustainability: the environment, i.e., to develop digital tools that can support people in transitioning to practices that reduce the environmental footprint, and the social welfare, i.e., to make sure that digital tools enable users to retain ownership on their personal data.

PRIMO combines research methods from computer science to collect and analyze technical data related to privacy and social science to understand the perception of users with respect to the protection of their personal data.
